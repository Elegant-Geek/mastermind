# coding started at 11:31PM
# finished set up of set_player names 12:15AM
# finished storing names as players with default characters. 12:58AM
# refined conditionalls for nil / blank names
# first github / git commmit at 1:55AM
# finish rough draft (still buggy with what counts as a win) as of 4:51AM OOPS
# 11:15-3:15 (4 hours) cleaned up cmd line output, improved conditional statement logic, and wrote the code to match / catch the winning amounts to the player combo array!
